DSG
===

DSG (Distributed Scene Graph) is an addon module for the [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page) project. It allows for the simulation workload of a single region to be spread across multiple simulators, servers and geographies. Each simulator hosts a duplicate of the region and performs one or more simulation tasks for the space. The region's scene objects, avatars, scripts, events, etc are maintained across the different simulators through a scene synchronization protocol. Physics, Scripting, Scene Persistence and Client Management are the most common built-in simulation tasks that may benefit from distribution. 

**NOTE:** This particular Github repository will not be updated. For improved versions of DSG, follow the forks from this repository.
